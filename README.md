# Logistics Optimization Project

This repository contains a data science project focused on optimizing delivery times using various transportation modes and routes. The goal of the project is to minimize the overall delivery time across different supply chain routes.

## Project Overview
The project solves a logistics optimization problem using Python and linear programming. We use data from supply chains, such as routes, transportation modes, and lead times.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for optimization.

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
